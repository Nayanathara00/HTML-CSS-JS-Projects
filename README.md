# HTML-CSS-JS-Projects
This repository showcases a collection of 16 simple projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects were developed as part of my personal learning journey to gain proficiency in these three languages. Each project demonstrates various aspects of web development, including responsive layouts, interactive features, and dynamic functionality. To develop these projects, I followed a YouTube tutorial series "HTML CSS JS projects (Beginner): 16 projects using HTML CSS and JavaScript" by 'JavaScript King'. The tutorial series provided step-by-step guidance and explanations, helping me grasp the fundamentals and build practical web applications.
